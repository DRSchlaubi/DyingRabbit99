# Before Contributing

If you want to implement a new feature, please create an issue with a proposal and detailed description of the added feature first.
Wait for the issue to be approved. Otherwise, the PR will likely not get accepted and the work will be in vain.
The same applies to any other major changes that take a little longer to implement.

# How To Contribute

Fork the project.

If you only want to change three lines at most, you may just edit the branch "dev".
For more complex contributions, create a new branch for your implementation. Please mind the branch naming conventions.
Branches that implement a new feature are called "feature/FEATURE-NAME".
Branches that fix a bug are called "bug/BUG-NAME".
Always create your new branch of from the branch "dev"!

When creating a pull request, please refer to any related issues your contribution solves or affects.

# What Happens To Your Pull Request

If your pull request gets accepted it will be revised and eventually be merged completely or partially into the "dev" branch.
Note that your new feature may be put on hold for a while if the changes donÂ´t fit into the next release.
Usually, you can assume your changes will be taken over within the following two releases.
